3D-Printer-Vision-Error-Correction-System
=========================================

A project for Virginia Tech Mechatronics Lab started in Fall of 2014. The goal of this project is to assist in the detection of printing errors for Virginia Tech DREAMS Lab's DreamVendor 2.0. The idea is to use both a real and virtual image capture-comparison system to detect (and potentially correct) errors that commonly occur with 3D printers.
